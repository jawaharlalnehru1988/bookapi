    {
        "question": "What is Jasmine?",
        "answer": "Jasmine is a popular open-source behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework for JavaScript that allows developers to write tests for their JavaScript code. It provides a clean and expressive syntax for writing specs (tests), making it easy to write and maintain test suites. Jasmine can be used with a variety of JavaScript frameworks and libraries, including AngularJS, React, and Node.js."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why choose Jasmine Framework?",
        "answer": "There are several reasons why developers choose to use Jasmine for testing their JavaScript code:\n\n1. BDD syntax: Jasmine's syntax is based on behavior-driven development (BDD) principles, which allows developers to write more expressive and understandable tests.\n\n2. Easy to learn: Jasmine is easy to learn and can be picked up quickly by developers who are new to testing.\n\n3. Extensive feature set: Jasmine provides an extensive set of built-in matchers, spies, stubs, and mocks, making it easy to write complex tests.\n\n4. Active community: Jasmine has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the project and provide support to others.\n\n5. Integrations: Jasmine can be integrated with a variety of tools and frameworks, including test runners like Karma and Jest, and Continuous Integration (CI) tools like Travis CI and Jenkins.\n\nOverall, Jasmine is a reliable and widely-used testing framework that can help developers ensure the quality and reliability of their JavaScript code."
